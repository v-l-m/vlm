            <li>Le serveur web et celui h&eacute;bergeant la base de donn&eacute;es sont financ&eacute;s par Actilis (actilis.net), la soci&eacute;t&eacute; dont le mainteneur est le g&eacute;rant, qui les finance int&eacute;gralement, et utilise aussi le serveur de bases de donn&eacute;es pour h&eacute;berger d\'autres bases de donn&eacute;es. Vous n\'avez donc pas besoin d\'envoyer vos dons au mainteneur, qui pr&eacute;f&egrave;re largement vos messages d\'encouragement et aime bien les cartes postales parvenant d\'endroits qu\'il ne connait pas.</li>
            <li>Vous pouvez soumettre des parcours, informer le mainteneur des nouvelles courses r&eacute;elles afin qu\'elles soient aussi programm&eacute;es dans VLM pour que nous les courrions en virtuel simultan&eacute;ment. Il faut : la position latitude/longitude du point de d&eacute;part, l\'heure de d&eacute;part, et la position de la ligne d\'arriv&eacute;e.</li>
            <li>Vous pouvez partager vos connaissances sur la mer, les marins et les bateaux sur le portail Maritime de Wikipedia: <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikip%C3%A9dia:Portail_Maritime">Portail maritime</a></li>
            <li>Si vous &ecirc;tes propri&eacute;taire, vous pouvez proposer un embarquement au concepteur, ce qu\'a d&eacute;j&agrave; entrepris le mainteneur, d&egrave;s que le printemps reviendra. Mais si vous poss&eacute;dez un plus gros canote que le First 24 (un 60 pieds nomm&eacute; VM Mat, Veolia, PRB..., un  cata nomm&eacute; Orange 2 ou un tri nomm&eacute; Groupama 3), n\'h&eacute;sitez pas &agrave; proposer un embarquement aux deux, ils ont tous les deux un point de chutte &agrave; Lorient.</li>
            <li>Sinon, vous pouvez aussi offrir un Alliage 38 rouge ou un Opium 39 (mais petit tirant d\'eau si possible). J\'en connais une qui trouvera alors que finalement, tout le temps pass&eacute; sur le developpement VLM aura servi &agrave; quelque chose :-)</li>

Sie wird vom Internetportal Virtual-Winds.com unterstützt und verfügt über ein Forum <i>(die Kneipe)</i> und über <i>Chats</i>.   Dies sind Stätten der Geselligkeit in denen Sie Kontakt zu Spielern aller Länder und aller Altersklassen finden werden.
