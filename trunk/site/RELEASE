This is the biggest release (counting the number of tickets) of the last two years. A lot of work still happen in the backoffice.
The nice story is that there has been about ten different people for tests & documentation tasks.
We are now looking at interface refactoring & communication tools around or in VLM.

A final word : VLM is OPEN. Which means :
- free software : people can find and report bugs
- open datas, open interfaces, open format : free datas are accessible in a documented format, externals interfaces are provided when possible : people can build tools prodiving a new experience of VLM, or whatever is fun to write :)
- open developement : new developers have just to jump in : please ask and join the developers mailing list.
- open window : We strongly rely on users to find bugs and explain how to reproduce them.

A big thanks to all the admins, tools developers, testers, wikify-ers for their help and support.
Special thanks to Jose, who did this time the spanish translation.
