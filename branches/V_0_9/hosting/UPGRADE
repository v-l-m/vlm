From 0.9.7 To next...
   Add a column in "races" table :
   mysql>     alter table races add vacfreq tinyint default 5;

   It is(will be) used when when the engine runs (once per minute), and il selects races to run :
   - when minute%10 == 0 : selects all races
   - when minute%5  == 0 : selects all races having 5 here
   - when minute%2  == 0 : selects all races having 2 here
   - whenever else       : selects all races having 1 here.

   Add a column update_comment to the table "updates". It lists races concerned by each update.
   mysql>     alter table updates add update_comment varchar(256);
